<h1>Thank you for swinging by👋</h1>

I am Jakob, a data allrounder currently building the data architecture for Gitpod. I've taken the decision to take my projects private for the time being as they're already many years old and no longer maintained, do not provide much value anymore and are in general no good representation of the technologies I work with nowadays. I will work on some small projects in the future, so keep an eye out!👀

In the meantime, if you want to get in touch to talk about data at an early-stage startup, the best way to reach out to me is via LinkedIn🤝
